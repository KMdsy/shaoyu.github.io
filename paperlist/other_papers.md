## Anomaly detection

  > The work that is the most related to ours is **AnoGAN (Schlegl et al., 2017)**.

  > **Bergmann et al. (2019)** compare standard AE reconstructions techniques
  > to AnoGAN, and observes that AnoGAN’s performances on anomaly localizations tasks are
  > poorer than AE’s due to the mode collapse tendency of GAN architectures. Interestingly, updates on
  > AnoGAN such as **fast AnoGAN (Schlegl et al., 2019)** or **AnoVAEGAN (Baur et al., 2018)** replaced
  > the gradient descent search of the optimal z with a learned encoder model, yielding an approach
  > very similar to the standard VAE reconstruction-based approaches, but with a reconstruction loss
  > learned by a discriminator, which is still prone to mode collapse (Thanh-Tung et al., 2019).
